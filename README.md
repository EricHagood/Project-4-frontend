##Project 4, An app to help encourage exploration
I designed this app using a React front and and the google maps API. The function of the program is to generate a set of coordinates for the user to travel to and document which encourages exploration. These Coordinates can be literally anywhere in the world including the ocean. This app was desinged primarily to test my skills and to learn new technologies but also partly as a joke. 
##Technologies Used
I used React, Python, Flask, SQL, And the Google Maps API to create this app.
##~~Features~~ Bugs
There is a input that is supposed to limit coordinates to a city and mile limit, I didn't have time to implement this feature so as of now it does nothing ~~Though this does further the joke~~ Also there seems to be an issue with the image upload. I didn't have time to diagnose if this was an issue with the front end or the back end by the base64 decoding isn't working properly and as such the images aren't being properly displayed. While all of the google maps API calls work perfectly, the google maps component doesn't seem to be quite functioning correctly and while the marker text is placed on the generated coordinates the map center is not changing nor is the map panning on coordinate generation. This is a feature I hope to add in the future of this app as the google maps react component is something I wish to master.
